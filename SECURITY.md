# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided on a best-effort basis for the latest release of each supported major version (`v6`, `v7`, `v8`, and `v9`).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please open an issue at <https://github.com/KromDaniel/rejonson/issues> and include "[security]" in the title so we can triage it quickly. We aim to acknowledge new reports within 5 business days.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and the potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code, if available.
- Any known mitigations or workarounds.

We will coordinate with you to investigate and remediate the issue as quickly as possible. Once a fix is available and released, we will credit you unless you request otherwise.
